## 💾 Personal-Basement Scaffold

This is a personal full-stack project base template integrating modern front-end and back-end technologies with a high-performance gateway. 

This scaffold provides pre-configured basic code and core dependencies to help developers quickly set up a project featuring **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend, **Vite (Frontend)** for building, and **OpenResty (High-Performance Gateway)** for routing, and an easy-use **JSON Mocker** for data simulation.

### 🚀 Technology Stack Overview

| Domain | Key Technology | Description |

| **Backend** | **Spring Boot (Java)** | Provides a fast development experience for easily configured RESTful API services. |
| **Frontend** | **Vite / TypeScript** | An extremely fast front-end build tool, combined with TypeScript for more robust code. |
| **Gateway** | **OpenResty (Lua)** | A high-performance web platform based on Nginx, used for reverse proxy, load balancing, and API routing. |
| **Build Tool** | **Maven** | Dependency management and build tool for the Java project. |
